As part of my final year at BITS-Pilani Dubai Campus, I completed a credited Data Science course that included a practical project component. For this project, I developed and implemented a Sentiment Analysis system for Movie Reviews using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The implementation utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and was coded in Python. This project demonstrated my ability to apply advanced data science concepts to real-world problems, combining natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies.
